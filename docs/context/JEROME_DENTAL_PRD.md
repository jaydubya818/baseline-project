# Jerome's Dental Front-Office Agent
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## Executive Summary

Jerome's Dental Front-Office Agent is an AI-driven "Morning Huddle" automation platform for dental practices. It acts as an intelligence layer on top of legacy Practice Management Systems (PMS) like Dentrix/Eaglesoft, using a hybrid on-premises/cloud architecture to ensure HIPAA compliance while delivering powerful AI-driven insights.

The system automatically generates role-specific daily briefs, identifies clinical and financial risks, and surfaces revenue opportunities—all while maintaining strict patient data privacy through on-premises PHI sanitization.

---

## 1. Product Vision

### 1.1 Core Concept

An AI-driven "Morning Huddle" automation platform for dental practices. It acts as an intelligence layer that sits on top of legacy Practice Management Systems (PMS) like Dentrix/Eaglesoft without requiring direct API cooperation (uses screen-scraping/OCR if needed).

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition

- **Automated Morning Huddle:** Generates a concise daily brief for the team (Dentists, Hygienists, Admin).
- **Zero-Integration Data Capture:** Capable of running a local "Agent" on-premise to screen-scrape or query local DBs, then send sanitized metadata to the cloud.
- **Risk Flagging:** Proactively identifies medical risks (allergies), financial risks (unpaid balances), and scheduling gaps.

### 1.3 User Personas

1. **Dr. David (Dentist):** Needs clinical context, revenue opportunities (e.g., unscheduled crowns), and medical alerts.
2. **Haley (Hygienist):** Needs X-ray due dates, perio charting gaps, and anxiety alerts.
3. **Rachel (Front Desk):** Needs prioritized tasks, payment collection alerts, and schedule hole filling.
4. **Michael (Manager):** Needs production vs. goal metrics and staff coverage assurance.

---

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Hybrid Deployment Model

To satisfy HIPAA and legacy integration, the system uses a split architecture:

**On-Premises Agent (The "Hand"):**
- A lightweight Python/Docker service running on the dental office server
- Connects to PMS (Dentrix/Eaglesoft)
- Runs local screen scraping/OCR
- De-identifies PHI before sending to cloud
- Pushes sanitized JSON to Cloud API

**Cloud Control Plane (The "Brain"):**
- SaaS platform hosting the AI and dashboard
- LLM inference and business logic
- Web Dashboard delivery
- Authentication and authorization
- Aggregated reporting across practices

### 2.2 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI |
| Backend (Cloud) | Python (FastAPI) |
| Backend (Local Agent) | Python, Selenium/Playwright, PyInstaller |
| Database (Cloud) | PostgreSQL (Supabase or AWS RDS) |
| Database (Local) | SQLite for caching |
| AI Orchestration | LangGraph (stateful agent flows) |
| LLMs | Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) for HIPAA BAA compliance |
| Local AI | Mistral for on-prem PII filtering |

### 2.3 Data Flow

1. **Trigger:** 6:00 AM Local Agent wakes up via scheduled task
2. **Extract:** Agent scrapes daily schedule from PMS
3. **Sanitize:** Agent hashes/tokenizes sensitive PII (SSN, etc.) locally
4. **Upload:** Agent sends sanitized JSON payload to Cloud API (TLS 1.3)
5. **Process:** Cloud HuddleAgent analyzes payload, generates summaries via LLM
6. **Display:** Staff logs into Next.js Dashboard to view "Morning Huddle"

### 2.4 Security & Compliance (HIPAA)

- **Audit Trails:** Every DB read/write and AI inference logged in immutable `audit_log` table
- **Encryption:** AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Strict roles (Provider, Admin, Staff)
- **PHI Minimization:** All PHI processed on-premises; only de-identified data in cloud

---

## 3. Agent Workflow Design (LangGraph)

### 3.1 Master Agent: HuddleSupervisor

The HuddleSupervisor orchestrates the flow of creating the morning brief, coordinating four specialized sub-agents.

### 3.2 Sub-Agents

**IngestionAgent:**
- Input: Raw text/CSV/JSON from local agent
- Task: Normalizes data into ScheduleSchema, fixes messy OCR text
- Output: Clean, structured patient appointment list

**RiskScannerAgent:**
- Input: Normalized Patient List
- Task: Checks against Rules Engine (e.g., "If Age > 60 AND Procedure = Surgery -> Check for Blood Thinners")
- Output: List of RiskFlags with severity levels

**RevenueAgent:**
- Input: Patient History and current schedule
- Task: Identifies "Unscheduled Treatment" opportunities
- Output: List of revenue opportunities with estimated values

**WriterAgent:**
- Input: Schedule + RiskFlags + Opportunities
- Task: Generates 3 distinct summaries (Clinical, Hygiene, Admin)
- Output: Role-specific morning huddle briefs

### 3.3 Data Structures

```python
class PatientAppt(BaseModel):
    id: str
    time_slot: datetime
    patient_name: str  # Tokenized in cloud
    procedure_code: str
